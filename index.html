<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to my software projects hosted on GitHub.</h3>

<p>The following projects demonstrate key features of the projects that I have developed or contribute to.  The source code can be viewed in greater detail on GitHub (Top Right), and

<h3><a id="BigData-implement" class="anchor" href="" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Big Data - Sentiment Analysis</a></h3> 
<p>Sentiment analysis refers to various methods of examining and processing data in order to identify a subjective response, people talk on social media.. this is their general mood or a group's opinions about a specific topic. 
<br>
<br>Using the Apache Hadoop framework, I create a Twitter Sentiment Analysis of Copa America 2015.  Using Hive Queries for Word count, we will analyze the data steam from the data sources. 
<br><br>
First we break sentences into words and count those words as we pass the data to the Hcatalog dictionary which will enable us to 
structure the raw data and score the sentiment.
<br>
Load - Refine - Visualize<br>
<br>There have been many examples of this type of analysis, using MapReduce algorithms of Mongodb, Rstudio (R statistical anaylsis), Distributed Computing in Matlab
 or Complex Event Processing - Streambase/Tibco.  HortonWorks and Amazon have specific tutorials on this type of analysis.
